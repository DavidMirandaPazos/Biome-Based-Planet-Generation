Running instructions
--------------------
After opening the program in the menu at the left, the last option is Save/Load. 
Open said option and click Load, it will open the windows explorer.
Navigate to the demo/EXE/Planets folder and select the .json of the planet you want to load (BiomesAndCities.json)
Again on the left menu click on Regenerate Sphere
The planet should already be generated. 

Camera Controls
---------------
A/W/S/D - Move around
E/Q 	- Zoom in/out

Other Controls
--------------
M	- Toogle wireframe
C/V	- In the NeighborsInfo drawing mode, change the selected triangle (+ Ctrl Held down to change faster)

Editing a planet
----------------
At the top of the right menu are the different visualization modes. 
Right below there are 2 paramenters that control the planet: Sea level and precision (as well as Apply height but that one is recommended not to be used)
	changing any of those 2 will require for the Sphere to be regenerated if we want to see the results
Below the update buttons the first 2 options (Noise Filter & Temperature map) also require for the sphere to be regenerated.
In contrast, either Biomes or Cities can be updated with the button "Update Biomes" which is much faster.

At the right menu there is a list of the biomes, when hovering the names, the area covered by the biome will be shown.
